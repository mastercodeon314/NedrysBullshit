# NedrysBullshit

This is a simple winforms app that loops a clip of Dennis Nedry saying "Ah ah ah, you didn't say the magic word" from Jurassic Park.
The sound file and video are played seperatly, but aligned because they both are looped. 
Uploading this to github because I love this clip and this little program loops it perfectly. This would make for a perfect troll to be intigrated into other code.
